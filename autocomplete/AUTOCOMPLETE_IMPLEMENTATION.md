## 🔄 Algorithm Details

### Levenshtein Distance
```javascript
// Calculates minimum edits needed to transform one string to another
// Threshold: 30% of query length for fuzzy matching
// Examples:
- "hary" → "harry" (distance: 1, threshold: 1) ✅ Match
- "gatsby" → "catsby" (distance: 1, threshold: 2) ✅ Match  
- "lorem" → "gatsby" (distance: 6, threshold: 2) ❌ No match
```

### Search Priority
1. **Exact Matches**: Perfect substring matches
2. **Fuzzy Matches**: Typo-tolerant matches using Levenshtein
3. **Category Ordering**: Titles → Authors → Genres
4. **Alphabetical**: Within categories, results are sorted alphabetically
